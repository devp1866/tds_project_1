# GitHub User & Repository Insights: Berlin:200

### Quick Highlights

- **Data Gathering Process**: Using the GitHub API, I scraped data on Berlin-based users with over 200 followers by iterating through paginated user profiles and each user's recent repositories, capturing details on profiles and projects to CSV files.
- **Surprising Finding**: One Berlin-based developer has amassed more than 26,000 followers, and the city’s most-starred repository has an impressive 83,000 stars.
- **Practical Tip for Developers**: Boost your profile by using popular licenses like "MIT" and teaming up with Berlin’s top-followed developers.
